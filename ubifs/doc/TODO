Wishlist for ubiboot-02
-----------------------

 - WLAN access for ubiboot maintanance mode.
   1.) Authentication, should port wpasupplicant. What else is required?
   2.) Mechanism in init to write the config files based on ubiboot.conf.
       What about case when gonfig file not found? maybe it's best to not
       activate WLAN then...
   3.) Should there be an icon for "access via WLAN" in menu, or just do it
       when menu is paused/waiting for input?

 - Check what happens when there is an alarm and the device is in charging mode?
