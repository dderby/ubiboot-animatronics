Wishlist for ubiboot-02
-----------------------

 - Fix the preinit.harmattan script. Currectly it fails on few occasions and
   there still is excess things, like the USB device IP address setup.

 - Finish the SSHD setup for ubiboot environment;
   1.) Get SSL libs to compile, what was the blocker again?
   2.) Patch SSHD to work in the root-only environment
   3.) Mechanism in init to get root password hash from ubiboot.conf and set
       it up in the /etc/passwd

 - Move the ubiboot-created log files to some more sensible location.
   Should it be configurable in ubiboot.conf or just store to ubiboot config
   directory? What about when config directory is on mtd4/mtd5?

 - WLAN access for ubiboot maintanance mode.
   1.) Authentication, should port wpasupplicant. What else is required?
   2.) Mechanism in init to write the config files based on ubiboot.conf.
       What about case when gonfig file not found? maybe it's best to not
       activate WLAN then...
   3.) Should there be an icon for "access via WLAN" in menu, or just do it
       when menu is paused/waiting for input?

 - Check what happens when there is an alarm and the device is in charging mode?
