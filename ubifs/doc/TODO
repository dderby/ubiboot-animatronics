Wishlist for ubiboot-02
-----------------------

 - Fix the preinit.harmattan script. Currectly it fails on few occasions and
   there still is excess things, like the USB device IP address setup.

 - Add runtime checks for the existance of kernel paths in ubiboot.conf so
   that user is given meaningful info is path does not exist.
   Maybe paths could be logged also, for easier problem solving?

 - Finish the SSHD setup for ubiboot environment;
   1.) Get SSL libs to compile, what was the blocker again?
   2.) Patch SSHD to work in the root-only environment
   3.) Mechanism in init to get root password hash from ubiboot.conf and set
       it up in the /etc/passwd

 - Move the ubiboot-created log files to some more sensible location.
   Should it be configurable in ubiboot.conf or just store to ubiboot config
   directory? What about when config directory is on mtd4/mtd5?

 - Modify init so that it will search all partitions for ubiboot.conf

 - WLAN access for ubiboot maintanance mode.
   1.) Authentication, should port wpasupplicant. What else is required?
   2.) Mechanism in init to write the config files based on ubiboot.conf.
       What about case when gonfig file not found? maybe it's best to not
       activate WLAN then...
   3.) Should there be an icon for "access via WLAN" in menu, or just do it
       when menu is paused/waiting for input?

 - Check what happens when there is an alarm and the device is in charging mode?

 - Addition to the boot CMDLINE handling; have an alternate method of giving
   boot parameters, either by using a pre-saved CMDLINE or appending given
   parameters to kernel command line.
