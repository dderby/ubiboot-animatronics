Wishlist for ubiboot-02
-----------------------

 - WLAN access for ubiboot maintanance mode.

   1.) Compiled wpa_supplicant. Tested preliminary, works.
       now what is needed is just the firmware startup...

   2.) Mechanism in init to write the config files based on ubiboot.conf.
       What about case when gonfig file not found? maybe it's best to not
       activate WLAN then...
       --> same as with SSHD config, use ubiboot.conf key.

   3.) Should there be an icon for "access via WLAN" in menu, or just do it
       when menu is paused/waiting for input?
       --> yes, add it under tools.

   4.) Startup of the wlan driver, firmware loading etc.
       The method used by normal Harmattan installation is way too complex.
       --> Have to hack up somethong with TI.configure utility...


 - Sillykbd-type standalone terminal in maintanance mode.
       How to handle scrolling etc? Maybe just show few lines?
       Maybe like fingerterm, KBD goes away when not in use and comes back
       aftr touching the screen?


 - Automatic mode for kernel listing.
       just give a directory and ubiboot creates a list on the flay of all
       kernels in the directory.
       --> would help with typos of kernel names in the current config
       Mostly implemented now, usable but as the directory listing is repeatedly
       generated it slows down the menu noticably.


 - Check what happens when there is an alarm and the device is in charging mode?
       --> nothing strange AFAIK?? what was the requirement again?


 - BME or something to supervise device charging.

       Currently what happens is that when in maintanance mode device does
       not charge due to the problems people were having with 1603 devices.
       Had to remove the DSME in startup...


 - Menuscript should check that the init script for the kernel exists and that
   it is executable.
       --> happens more than often that the device just hangs after a seemingly
           successiful loading of 2nd stage kernel. 


 - Add btrfs to supported filesystems
