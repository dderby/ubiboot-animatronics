	* Modified the automatic kernel listing so that it creates a temporary file to store the kernel name list. Hopefully that is quicker to handle than parsing the kernels from directory every iteration which caused noticeable lag in the menu.

2013-11-10 Jussi Ohenoja <juice@swagman.org>
	* Realised that evtap can only handle non-space-broken lines as return strings. Bummer, did a lot of debugging to find out why on earth I cannot use a kernel line containing spaces with automatic selection.
	* Third take on the automatic kernel listing based on a given directory. Could not export temporary values to another function, have to work around that.

2013-11-09 Jussi Ohenoja <juice@swagman.org>
	* Corrected a bug in pack_cpio.sh script: the archive root permssions were wrong.
	* Second take on the automatic kernel listing based on a given directory. Just found out that busybox does not support arrays in shell scripts, so had to code around it.
	* Fixed the log partition mounting logic in init and select_and_boot_os.sh

2013-11-08 Jussi Ohenoja <juice@swagman.org>
	* Corrected a bug in pack_cpio.sh script: the archive was not created with root-owned files, which led to problems when trying to ssh/sftp to the device as unpacking the cpio changed root ownership to 1000:1000 instead of 0:0.
	* Updated config interface version to 4.
	* First take on the automatic kernel listing based on a given directory.

2013-11-07 Jussi Ohenoja <juice@swagman.org>
	* Fixed a small bug in select_os_animated.sh script. The on-the-fly mapfile creation made an extra hook for the non-existing 6th line when there are 5 items in the menu. Props for peterleinchen for spotting this :)
