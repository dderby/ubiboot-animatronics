This repository contains the ubiboot-02 animation creation toolkit and filesystem
seed for the RAMFS of ubiboot kernel.

There are two scripts associated with animated menu creation;
 - create_animations.sh to compile the animation sequences.
 - pack_cpio.sh to create the CPIO format archve from the compiled sequence.

The directory imagebase/ holds the icon templates for menus.
The directory menuscripts/ holds the animation scripts and control files.
The directory ubifs/ holds the RAMFS seed.
