This repository contains the ubiboot-02 animation creation toolkit and filesystem
seed for the RAMFS of ubiboot kernel.


1. Content

  There are two scripts associated with animated menu creation;
   - create_animations.sh to compile the animation sequences.
   - pack_cpio.sh to create the CPIO format archve from the compiled sequence.

  The directory imagebase/ holds the icon templates for menus.
  The directory menuscripts/ holds the animation scripts and control files.
  The directory ubifs/ holds the RAMFS seed.


2. Usage

  For menu compilation, use ./create_animations.sh script. With no parameters it will
  read the content of imagebase/ and create a filesystem structure containing the
  animation sequences and needed scripts and configuration from menuscripts/.
  This hierarchy is written to a file called animatronics.tar

  To pack the whole menu system and support files into runnable archive, use command
  "./pack_cpio.sh --create animatronics.tar"
  This will output a file called ubiboot-02.menus.cpio which can be copied to ubiboot
  configuration directory of your device.
