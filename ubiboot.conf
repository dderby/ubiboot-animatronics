# Now follow the bootable OS'es and kernels on the device, this is the structure of the 2nd level menu.
# There are two different methods for kernel listing, automatic and manual. The selection between the modes
# is by G_OS<x>_AUTOLOCATION key. When set to "" the manual selection list is used, when set to a directory
# location the kernel listing is generated from the dirrectory automatically.
# Due to screen resolution issues, the maximum length of the kernel label is 30 characters.
#
# Manual kernel selection:
#
# - Each OS has 6 slots for kernels, but all need not be defined. Each used slot needs a G_OS<x>_<n>_LABEL
#   that defines the text shown on the menu line and G_OS<x>_<n>_FILE which defines the kernel-to-boot, path
#   is relative to the ubiboot FS.
# - The G_OS<x>_NUM parameter defines the number of kernel lines shown on the 2nd level menu.
#   Be careful to NOT give values in this variable exceeding the number of your used slots.
# - The G_OS<x>_AUTOBOOT defines the slot that is used to boot automatically, user does not need to press
#   the kernel line to boot this selection. Useful only if you have just one kernel line defined for an OS.
#   Setting this variable to zero disables the autoboot on the OS entry.
# - The G_OS<x>_PARTITION and G_OS<x>_NAME define the partiton number and link name that the kernels reside on.
#   This is necessarily not the same location that the OS is installed, though, just the kernel loading location.
#
# Automatic kernel selection
#
# - The system reads the kernel files from location defined by G_OS<x>_AUTOLOCATION. All files matching zImage_*
#   are collected for listing, but only the first 6 are listed.
# - When automatic kernel listing is enabled, G_OS<x>_NUM key and G_OS<x>_AUTOBOOT are not meaningful.
# - When the listing is generated, the zImage_ is stripped from the kernel name and the rest of the name is
#   used as the label presented to the user.
