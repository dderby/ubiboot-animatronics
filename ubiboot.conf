# Log file creation.
# Normally ubiboot-02 creates two log files which are appended to at every boot.
# The ubiboot.dmesg log contains the kernel log and ubiboot.log contains the userspace log.
# The default setting, "partition_1/boot/" places the log files in the Harmattan's "/home/user/MyDocs/boot",
# the same directory that your ubiboot-02 config and cpio normally are located.
# Of course you can place them also in the traditional "partition_2:/var/log", for example.

# Now follow the bootable OS'es and kernels on the device, this is the structure of the 2nd level menu.
# Due to screen resolution issues, the maximum length of the kernel label is 30 characters.
#
# - Each OS has 6 slots for kernels, but all need not be defined. Each used slot needs a G_<osname>_<n>_LABEL
#   that defines the text shown on the menu line and G_<osname>_<n>_FILE which defines the kernel-to-boot, path
#   is relative to the ubiboot FS.
# - The G_<osname>_NUM parameter defines the number of kernel lines shown on the 2nd level menu.
#   Be careful to NOT give values in this variable exceeding the number of your used slots.
# - The G_<osname>_AUTOBOOT defines the slot that is used to boot automatically, user does not need to press
#   the kernel line to boot this selection. Useful only if you have just one kernel line defined for an OS.
#   Setting this variable to zero disables the autoboot on the OS entry.
